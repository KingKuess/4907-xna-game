# 4907-xna-game
This is a 2d game made with XNA for a 4th year project.

If you want to see a quick demo I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hYxFu5rV3U

You can possibly run this yourself if you have the xna redistributables installed which ive included in this repo.

Keep in mind this is an incomplete project and intended for learning purposes and will most likely be unrunnable by anyone who is not a developer for now.

2. you can get the executable at
